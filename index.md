### Last Results (12.08.2020)
# Data: 
**266 proteins, 12 Controls, 37 Cases**
# Model:
- Internal (for each pair of proteins p1 and p2): radial SVM (crossvalidation) - weights of connection = probability to beloning class 1
```markdown
svmFit <- train(Group ~ p1 + p2 (or + AGE),
                  data = data, method = "svmRadial", preProc = c("center", "scale"),metric = "ROC",
                  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary))
```
                                           
- External (for network characterisitcs): glm (LOOCV)
```markdown
glmFit <- train(Group ~ (1 network characterisitc),
                  data = df_train, method = "glm", preProc = c("center", "scale"), metric = "ROC",
                  trControl = trainControl(method = "LOOCV", classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary))

## Can we reduce number of proteins?
For each edge calculate avarage "weight" for 0-group and avarage "weight" for 1-group

Looks like "red cloud" <- pairs of proteins where SVM didn't find solution (I think these guys were the ones who spoiled the previous models).

Calculation of how often each protein is found in the blue cloud (we think that if a protein is significant, then it will be found there more often, that is, the better other pairs with it will distinguish between groups).

I selected only those proteins if the number of their connections that got into the blue cloud is more than half of all proteins.
