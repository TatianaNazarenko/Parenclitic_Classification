# Data: 
**266 proteins, 12 Controls, 37 Cases**
# Model
- Internal (for each pair of proteins): radial SVM (crossvalidation) - weights of connection = probability to beloning class 1
```markdown
svmFit <- train(Group ~ p1 + p2 + **AGE**,
                  data = data, method = _"svmRadial"_, preProc = c("center", "scale"),metric = "ROC",
                  trControl = trainControl(method = **"cv"**, classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary))
```
                                           
- External (for network characterisitcs): glm (LOOCV)
```markdown
glmFit <- train(Group ~ _1 network characterisitc_,
                  data = df_train, method = _"glm"_, preProc = c("center", "scale"), metric = "ROC",
                  trControl = trainControl(method = **"LOOCV"**, classProbs = TRUE, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary))
